Svelte-TailwindCSS UI (STWUI) is currently in pre-release. There has been a lot work already but a lot of work still needs to be done. Most of my inspiration comes from TawilwindUI with a desire to create a component library similar to React component libraries that are less reliant on remembering class names. Contributors and collaborators welcome!

<br />

A showcase can be found at [https://stwui.vercel.app/](https://stwui.vercel.app/). Documentation is still forthcoming but you can at least see the components being used.

# Installing

- Run `npm install stwui`
- Add `require('stwui/plugin')` to the `plugins` section of your `tailwind.config.cjs`
- Add `'./node_modules/stwui/**/*.{svelte,js,ts,html}'` to the `content` array of your `tailwind.config.cjs`

```
module.exports = {
	content: [
		'./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}',
		'./node_modules/stwui/**/*.{svelte,js,ts,html}'
	],
	plugins: [
		require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
		require('stwui/plugin')
	]
};
```
